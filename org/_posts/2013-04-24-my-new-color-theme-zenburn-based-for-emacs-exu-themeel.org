* Why one more colortheme?

In my office i have very big windows and after 1PM brightness is killing my
ability to see letters in my previous emacs setup with Zenburn colortheme.

It's good to see shiny day but my low contrast [[https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs][Zenburn Theme]] is too bright and I
often don't see elements with lower contrast.

* exu-theme.el

** Installation

You can grab it from my [[https://github.com/exu/emacs.d/blob/master/themes/exu-theme.el][emacs github repository]] (if You are using Emacs 24
simply put it into `~/.emacs.d/themes` directory and add lines below into
your `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file to load this theme

#+begin_src elisp :results replace output :exports both
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
(load-theme 'exu t)
#+end_src


** Below are some screenshots of my new theme:
