* The blogger exodus
I've migrated old blog on http://blog.wysocki.org.pl to http://exu.github.io. Why? It looks
like good idea to have everything in git. And what is most important I want to write my posts
in Org-mode (markdown sucks so much!)


I've used several tools to complete:

- Jekyll http://jekyllrb.com/
- http://jekyllbootstrap.com/
- https://gist.github.com/kennym/1115810 (I've changed `Config` to `RbConfig` because of deprecation warning)'

* TODO Left:

- [ ] Migrate domain: blog.wysocki.org.pl
- [ ] Make some Bootstrap layout
