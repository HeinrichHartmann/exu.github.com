* The blogger exodus

I wan't to start writting some blog posts so I've thought that I will start from
migration of My old blog on Blogger (http://blog.wysocki.org.pl) to new and shiny
Jekyll powered blog engine (http://exu.github.io) - domain will be changed later.
Why? It looks like good idea to have everything in git. And what is most important
I can write my posts in Org-mode (markdown sucks so much!)


** I've used several tools to complete this job:

- Jekyll http://jekyllrb.com/
- http://jekyllbootstrap.com/
- https://gist.github.com/kennym/1115810 (I've changed `Config` to `RbConfig` because of deprecation warning)'

** Todo Left [2/5]:

- [X] Make new home page
- [ ] Add some static pages with informations
- [ ] Migrate domain: blog.wysocki.org.pl
- [ ] Make some Bootstrap layout
- [X] Find some nice font
