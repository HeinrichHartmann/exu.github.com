* Introduction

In these series of posts I want to show differences between PHP and
Google's Golang.

I've completed some TDD excercises from 12TDDFORCHRISTMASSWEBSITE. First
I 've done that in PHPSpec, next was go, after some research I choose Ginkgo
as main go TDD/Spec framework. In next posts I'll try to show how I completed
these excercises

** TODO Link to setup of golang

** TODO Link to PHP


* TODO PHPSpec basics

Link to my phpspec bootstrap


* TODO Ginkgo basics

Link to ginkgo site

* End

Link to first excercise
