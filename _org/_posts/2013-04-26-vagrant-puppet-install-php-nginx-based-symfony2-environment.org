Before incoming Symfony2 training I've decided to upgrade a little [[https://github.com/exu/puppet-symfony][puppet-symfony
configuration for our developers]] (original on https://github.com/l3l0/puppet-symfony).



** Requirements:
- Virtualbox 4.2+ (I've installed from deb package on VBox site https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)
- Vagrant - installed it from http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.2.2
- Puppet - installed from =gem install puppet= (You'll need [[https://rvm.io/rvm/install/][ruby]])

** Next Clone the puppet modules and manifests into your project:

#+begin_src sh
cd your-project
git clone git://github.com/exu/puppet-symfony.git .puppet
#+end_src

** Create symlink to a Vagrantfile:

#+begin_src sh
ln -s .puppet/Vagrantfile ./Vagrantfile
#+end_src


** Boot your virtual machine:

#+begin_src sh
vagrant up
#+end_src

** Finally ssh into it once it boots:

#+begin_src sh
vagrant ssh
#+end_src

** Networking details

- VMs network is configured in host-only mode to handle IP 10.0.100.110.
- Your client accessing it with IP: 10.0.100.1.
- You can =ssh vagrant@10.0.100.110= (default password is =vagrant=)

** Next you should add vagrant.dev to your hosts file ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)][/etc/hosts]])

#+begin_src sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "10.0.100.110 vagrant.dev" >> /etc/hosts'
#+end_src

** Editing files on VM

To edit files you can install sshfs =sudo apt-get install sshfs= and then mount project directory
wherever you want (I've mounted it in  =/home/exu/Training directory=, use directory where you want to mount it)

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install sshfs
sshfs vagrant@10.0.100.110:/home/vagrant/vagrant.dev /home/exu/Training
#+end_src

If you don't want to enter your password you can execute =ssh-copy-id vagrant@10.0.100.110= first (if you use [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_infrastructure][PKI]]).

** Additional tips:

If you don't want to provision machine after each restart (with new basic Symfony project) use =--no-provision=
when you run =vagrant up= command

#+begin_src sh
vagrant up --no-provision
#+end_src

I've added alias to speed up VM start

#+begin_src sh
alias vup='vagrant up --no-provision'
#+end_src

You can put it in your =.bashrc= or =.zshrc= file
